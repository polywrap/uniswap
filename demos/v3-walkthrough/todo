# Additional Feedback
- [ ] needs some intro/context part about what a wrapper is. there should also be more explanatory info about what the wrapper is doing as the experience goes on. maybe instead of the loading icon, some text could pop up to explain what's happening?
- [ ] might be better as one scrolling one page rather than slides
- [ ] very long right scroll to read output of the queries
- [ ] there is the ambiguous button for toggling between the javascript query view and the json.. no explanation around this which leaves me confused
- [ ] why am I not prompted for a web3 connection on the write queries?
