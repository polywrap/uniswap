# Source code
- [ ] copy-to-clipboard button

# Examples

# Additional
- [ ] show resolution path from ENS (link->app.ens) -> IPFS (link->wrappers)
- [ ] show imported types
- [ ] support examples w/ multiple invocations (i.e. workflows)
- [ ] needs some intro/context part about what a wrapper is. there should also be more explanatory info about what the wrapper is doing as the experience goes on. maybe instead of the loading icon, some text could pop up to explain what's happening?
- reduce code duplication
- cleanup code, ensure styling + layout is simple and done uniformly
